# Copy update: “we” → “I” voice (site-wide)

## What changed
I updated site copy across the project to convert first-person plural (“we/our/us”) statements into grammatically correct first-person singular (“I/my/me”) statements.

## Files updated
- contact.html
- policies.html
- notary-signings.html
- strategic-business-planning.html
- about.html
- README.md (only to keep the quoted CTA text consistent)

## Notes
- No layout, structure, navigation, or styling changes were made.
- Only text/copy was modified (pronouns + closely related contractions such as “we’ll” → “I’ll”, “we’re” → “I’m”, etc.).
